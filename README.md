# REX Player

A [Move Everything](https://github.com/charlesvestal/move-everything) module that plays Propellerhead ReCycle loop files on the Ableton Move. Each slice in the loop is mapped to a MIDI note for playback.

Supports mono and stereo `.rx2` files. Older `.rex` and `.rcy` formats are not supported.

## Installation

Install via the Module Store in Move Everything, or download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/charlesvestal/move-anything-rex/releases) and copy the `rex/` folder to your Move:

```
/data/UserData/move-anything/modules/sound_generators/rex/
```

## Adding Loops

Upload `.rx2` files through the Move Everything file manager, or copy them directly to the module's `loops/` directory on the device:

```
/data/UserData/move-anything/modules/sound_generators/rex/loops/
```
